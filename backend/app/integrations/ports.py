"""The boundary between AMAZONA and the outside world.

Every external data source an agent depends on is declared here as a Protocol
and nowhere else. An agent depends on the Protocol, never on a concrete
implementation and never on a vendor SDK (plan maestro §23):

    Agent → Domain Service → Port → Adapter → External API

That is what makes it possible to have a mock, a sandbox and a real provider for
the same domain, and to refuse the mock in production (Milestone 30, ADR 0008).

The per-domain packages of the plan maestro (`app/integrations/product_intelligence/`
and friends) arrive with the first real adapter, in Milestone 34. Creating five
empty folders now would be infrastructure for its own sake; what matters today is
that the contract exists and that every agent goes through it.
